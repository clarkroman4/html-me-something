                <p> Roman the Cat is named after Nikki Minaj's alter-ego, Roman Zolanski.
                    Don't judge.  I was 21 and in college. Roman's favorite foods are chicken tikka masala and White Russians, the latter courtesy of my alcoholic ex-boyfriend.

                    When I was first dating my now-husband,
                    I invited him to dinner at my apartment. Boy had never been to my apartment before,
                    and he let the cat out. So, here I am, running around the neighborhood, screaming this boy's
                    last name, and for all he knows, I'm a weirdo that named my cat after him, after only 2 months of dating.
                    He didn't go running at that moment, bless him, and Roman the dude found Roman the cat hiding in my apartment stairwell soon after.

            <h5>Susan</h5>

                <p>TSusan is my second cat and when I went to the shelter to get her, she crawled into my lap and immediately started purring.
                    <em>She was playing me like a fiddle.</em> Since then, the only times she's been sweet is when she wants something.
                    Food bowl empty? There's my sweet girl! Immediately after? She couldn't care less.
                </p>
                <p>Susan story time: After I moved to St. Louis, Susan was depressed. I was working 80 hours a week,
                    and she was home alone, far more often than she'd like. She started escaping, more and more often, 
                    and I <em>mostly</em> managed to catch her, save the one time I didn't. And that one time, boy howdy,
                    was an adventure. I put up posters, I checked the shelters, but after 4 months, gave her up as gone.
                    Then, after a harshly cold winter, I get a call from a vet in the middle of Illinois, asking if I was missing a cat. Girl managed
                    to get herself across the Missouri river, survive negative, icy temperatures, and finally get her microchip scanned.
                    <strong>Always microchip your pets, folks. And, as Bob Barker would say, spay and neuter 'em too.</strong>

                <p>Turk aka Turkey Bone Jones aka <em>the best boy.</em> Turk came from death row at the St. Louis Humane Society
                    and would have returned there, had we not been able to take him in. He came from a the home of my manager,
                    who was divorcing her husband, and couldn't keep him. Turk's favorite foods are everything.
                    Turk's about twenty pounds overweight, but the vet said that's okay, because he had a sad puppy-hood.

            <h5>Freddie</h5>

            <p>We never meant to keep Freddie. She was part of a litter we were fostering, but she had one strange eye - it was weepy and red.
                We kept putting off getting her spayed, thinking that we couldn't, not with an eye infection. But, it turns out, the kitten just had a gross eye.
                No infection, nothing. But, by the time we'd figured that out, she'd bonded with mama-cat Susan, and they were inseperable. <em>Boom</em> I guess that's how you get three cats.
            </p>
            <p>Freddie's favorite thing in the world is to  play the laundry game. The laundry game has simple rules: 
                you dump all the clean laundry on the bed, and move your hand under it. She can then climb the mountain of laundry, and attack the socks as they flop around. It's <em>hella</em> cute.

            <h5>Bean</h5>

            <p>I got Bean as a tiny puppy, and let me tell you, I immediately fell in love. Wouldn't you have?  <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49061662486_ceb724d4b7_m.jpg" target="_blank">Look at this girl!</a>
                I've regretted it ever since. Bean is the worst dog in the world. This week alone, she's destroyed roughly $200 dollars
                worth of stuff, including but not limited to: a phone charger, dress shoes, and the pump out of the very expensive water fountain (that I bought because she was too good to drink from the communal bowl.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Bean's favorite toy is a brick she carries around. I don't even know where she found it, but god she loves it.
